# Hi there

## I'm @WazzaMo (aka, Warwick Molloy)

I build stuff with the Unity Game Engine, including some assets on the Asset Store, branded as Lokel Digital.
- Orbit Designer
- Kreation.Arduino (2 kinds)

## Interests

3D visualisation in Unity and adding tangible interactions - I used to teach Tangible Interactions with Unity
at Monash University.

I also believe that people should travel to expand their horizons, open their minds to new cultures and become global citizens,
so I work at Rome2Rio as an Engineering Manager.
